        			<h2 class="date">Brief Overview</h2>
        			<p class="blog-content">The prediction model will take the input video and pass it into the object detection model to classify the different object up to the most accuracy. Then it will pass onto the attention model which will then pass onto the RNN network which will predict whether accident is going to happen or not. If the accident is about to happen an ALERT will be issued and a probability graph will be plotted.
						The probability graph gives a brief insight into how the probability ranges during the interval of the accident and if the total probability crossed a particular threshold the ALERT is issued.

        			<h2 class="date">Image Classification</h2>
        			<p class="blog-content">Convolution is defined as an operation, suppose we have an input I, and a kernel K to give an output, that tells us how the input I is modified by kernel. For a faster and better object detection, YOLO is a state-of-the-art algorithm which can detect objects in real time. YOLO is a convolutional network which gives multiple bounding boxes and probabilities simultaneously. We utilize the YOLO v3 extracted feature of an image for every frame, which helps in identifying potential danger and later fed to a combination of attention and LSTM model to predict the probability of accident based on the available information.</p>

				    <h1 class="blog-title">Recurrent Neural Network</h1>
        			<h2 class="date">LSTM</h2>
            		<p class="blog-content">A Neural network can be defined as a differential function which maps one kind of variable to another kind of variable. Like in classification problem we convert vector to vectors and in regression model we convert vector to scalars.
						Our model is a combination of sequence to vector model and encode where we feed sequence of images (frame) in the model and we predict at which frame whether the accident will occur using the probability generated by the attention model which we will see in the later section.
						¬For building a LSTM Network we replace every hidden unit with a LSTM cell and add another connection from every other cell called cell state. LSTM primarily were designed to mitigate and solve the vanishing and exploding gradient problem. An LSTM has the same flow as an recurrent neural network. IT processes data sequentially passing all information as it propagates forward. The difference is how the information is operated or processed inside a LSTM cell. These operations are used to allow the LSTM cell to forget or keep information.

The goal of predictive modeling is to answer this question: “Based on known past behavior, what is most likely to happen in the future?</p>
